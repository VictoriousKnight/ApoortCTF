We saw this image was being sent back and forth among two people over an open platform with some random conversations. On our investigation, we found that the conversation is used just to bluff us. But we believe that something must be hidden in this image. Our experts tried most of the possibilities to extract the hidden data inside the image, but couldn't. So, we need to call our best agent, you for this task. Would you like to help us in revealing the hidden info?

Hints: 
1. Terminal may fail in first try. 
2. Some encrytions have variant. Do you know some of them?
